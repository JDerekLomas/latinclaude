# Latin-to-English Translations: Verified Statistics

All figures below include source citations. Estimates are clearly marked.

---

## Methodology

### Data Collection
Statistics were gathered from:
1. **Official database websites** (Brepols, USTC, DOML, etc.) — accessed December 2024
2. **Publisher catalogues** (Harvard UP, CUA Press, Liverpool UP, Toronto UP)
3. **Peer-reviewed scholarship** (Buringh 2011 for manuscript statistics)
4. **Wikipedia** (for series counts where official sources unavailable)
5. **Internet Archive** (for volume counts of digitized collections)

### Verification Standard
- **Verified (✓)**: Figure appears on official source with direct quotation
- **Estimated (~)**: Calculated from verified figures or inferred from related data
- **Unknown (?)**: No authoritative source found

### Key Databases Consulted
| Database | URL | What It Contains |
|----------|-----|------------------|
| USTC | [ustc.ac.uk](https://ustc.ac.uk) | 1.6M editions (1450-1700), searchable by language |
| Library of Latin Texts | [brepolis.net](https://about.brepolis.net/library-of-latin-texts/) | 12,149 works, 167M words (240 BCE - 1965) |
| PHI Latin Texts | [latin.packhum.org](https://latin.packhum.org) | All Latin pre-200 CE |
| DOML | [domedieval.org](https://domedieval.org) | 91 volumes medieval texts |

### How to Verify These Numbers
1. **USTC**: Go to [ustc.ac.uk/search](https://ustc.ac.uk/search), use Language filter for "Latin" to get current count
2. **LLT**: Subscription required; statistics on [about.brepolis.net](https://about.brepolis.net/library-of-latin-texts/)
3. **Series volumes**: Count directly on publisher websites or [domedieval.org/volumes/](https://domedieval.org/volumes/)
